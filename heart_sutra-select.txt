Shariputra,
form does not differ from emptiness,
emptiness does not differ from form. 
That which is form is emptiness,
that which is emptiness form.

The same is true of feelings,
perceptions, impulses, consciousness.

---

Therefore, in emptiness no form, no feelings,
perceptions, impulses, consciousness.

No eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind;
no color, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch,
no object of mind;
no realm of eyes
and so forth until no realm of mind consciousness.

No ignorance and also no extinction of it,
and so forth until no old age and death
and also no extinction of them.

No suffering, no origination,
no stopping, no path, no cognition,
also no attainment with nothing to attain.

Now : Dao is the reason that the form [of the heart/mind] is full!
But people can not be strong enough to keep it â€“
goes and does not return,
It arrives but does not dwell.
Is it silent?
here is no one who can hear its sound.
Is it close?
It is residing in the heart/mind.
Is it very dim and obscure?
You can not see its form.
Is it very prolific?
It gives us all life.
You can not see its form,
You can not hear its voice,
Yet there is an order to its accomplishments.
We call it Dao.
